# Analog IC Design Internship – USB Microphone AFE (Sky130)
This repository documents my internship project as a student of Silicon University, conducted in June 2025 under the mentorship of Dr. Saroj Rout. The project focuses on designing an Analog Front-End (AFE) for a USB Microphone using open-source EDA tools and the Skywater 130nm PDK. I gained hands-on experience in the complete analog IC design flow—from system-level specifications to schematic design, simulation, layout, and verification—utilizing open-source EDA tools such as Xschem, NGSpice, Magic VLSI, and Netgen, built on the Skywater 130nm CMOS PDK.
The primary focus of this project was the design and implementation of an Analog Front-End (AFE) for a USB Microphone, alongside the development and analysis of foundational analog building blocks including current mirrors, differential pairs, and folded cascode operational amplifiers. Python-based simulation and characterization scripts were also employed for design validation.
This repository serves as a structured, version-controlled archive of my design journey, technical learnings, and project deliverables in analog VLSI.
